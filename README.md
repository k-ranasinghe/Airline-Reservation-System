# Overview

This is an academic project done as part of the Semester 3 Database Systems Module. A full stack
application integrated with a MySQL database was built for an Airline system. All the components 
required for booking ticket is integrated to the system. An Admin panel was also built into the
system for Data Analytics purposes which is discussed below. A large focus was given to the database
of the system as a part of the module focus. BCNF(Boyce-Codd Normal Form) was followed for optimal
performance. Measures against SQL injections such Stored Procedures and Input Validation were used.
Given below is the class diagram of the MySQL database. <br><br>
